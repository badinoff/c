# CS50 Projects
My solutions and projects for Harvard's CS50 course.
I am only starting my programmer's journey. I would appreciate any feedback!

I also deliberately do not use cs50.h and explore the classic, OG C.

My implementations will seem like an overkill, but I do it on purpose to enhance my learning experience.

## Structure
- `week1/`: [Empty]
- `week2/`: Scrabble game completed. Additional features (isalpha, reprompt on EOF, versioning scripts for git) added beyond problem set requirements.
- `week3/`: [Empty]

## Usage
Clone and `cd` to a week folder, then `gcc` the `.c` files.
