Following C For Absolute Beginners book

I don't just copy paste code examples from the book. Instead, I try to either write the code myself based on requirements from the book, or even modify programs to be more robust and to handle potential edge cases. Or I would look at the program if I am not sure on implementation, and then try to replicate it after I understand how the logic works.

These are my first attempts at learning C, therefore some programs are at elementary level. Don't judge :)
